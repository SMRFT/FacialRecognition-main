How to test:

Initialize
- cansecurity.init() with sessionKey, getUser and validatePassword - need initial info for testing
- start up express with the right path
- create http client for Web requests

Testing: Make Web requests with
	User/Pass
	- no credentials - test that no user is there, no authtoken returned, returned 200
	- incorrect credentials - test that no user is there, returns 401 unauthorized and authtoken of error=invalidpass
	- correct credentials - test that user is in request, returns 200 along with an authtoken of success=<something>
	Authtoken
	- invalid authtoken - test that no user is there, returns authtoken error=invalidtoken, returns 200
	- expired authtoken - test that no user is there, returns no authtoken, returns 200
	- valid authtoken - test that user is there, returns 200 along with a new authtoken
	Express Session
	- login using user/pass, get authtoken back, new request without authtoken, should get 200 and new authtoken back
